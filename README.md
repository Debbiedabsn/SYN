# SYN
SYN is the artistic research project of a group of students at the UdK Berlin. Our ambition is to open up synesthesia as a source for an almost magical form of creative record. For most of us, people with synesthesia have separate sensory perceptions interconnected with each other in unusual ways. Numbers have characters, sounds have texture, and people have color. In psychology, this is called intermodal integration; "that is, shape, color, movement, sound, feeling tone, all different heterogeneous things are related to each other in such a way that they become mentally manageable for us as at least temporary unities. "1  
 
In order to make the different sensory perceptions of synaesthetes readable as data sets for AI, we started a call and lo and behold - a surprisingly large number of people at our university knew this whimsical perception all too well. So we first conducted interviews and created an image pool based on the described perceptions, with which we trained a text-to-image model in the next step. With the help of this model, we generated the image sequences that can be seen in the video. Why all this? Because we believe that synesthesia as a way of life can "give objects (...) a new form of multidimensionality, of ambiguity, of complexity and meaningfulness "2. And why shouldn't more people be inspired by such a kind of perspective in their generative design work! 
 
Our intention is not to code creativity, but to treat AI as a "tool of the imagination "3 that is not only used to solve predefined problems, but to approach problem areas and uncover questions in the process. Because in order to enter into a creative symbiosis with the machine, we must learn to speak its language. Have to find new, creative translations for our design work and practice prompt poetry instead of prompt engineering.

This model is trained on differently shaped textures, shapes and settings. Try the following captions when writing your prompt:

SYNSPHA  - Sphere 
SYNKREIS – Circle 
SYNTRIA – Triangle 
SYNQUAD – Square
SYNLINE – Line
SYNTOND – Dark spaces 
SYNLOT  - Light Tunnels
