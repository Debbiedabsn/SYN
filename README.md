# SYN
SYN is a creative research project that explores synesthesia as an AI data set. We interviewed synaesthetes, created an image pool, and trained an AI text-to-image model. They use AI as a tool of the imagination and practice prompt poetry. The model is trained on various shapes and settings and can be prompted with different captions.
